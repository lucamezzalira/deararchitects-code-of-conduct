# Dear Architects - Code of Conduct

## TL;DR
Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue, contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.

## Respect
Dear Architects slack channels are inclusive environments, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, medical conditions, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), physical appearance, politics, ideology (real world or tech), or software preferences.

__We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.__

Respectful behavior includes:

Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.
Dear Architects prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.

Dear Architects organizers reserve the right not to act on complaints regarding:
‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Resolve peacefully
We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an organizer. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just icky in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

## Apologize for mistake
Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. __No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.__

## Consequences
If the organizers determine that an event participant is behaving disrespectfully, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the event without warning or refund.

As organizers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can't foresee every situation however, and thus if in the organizers' judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.

## Resolving an Issue
If you believe you’re experiencing practices which doesn’t meet the policies below, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact the event organizer(s).

If you believe you’re experiencing practices in chat which don’t meet the policies above, please immediately contact any ally you may know. Anyone in the community should feel empowered to resolve issues and uphold our high standards.

However if you feel the issue requires escalation to a community organizer please contact:
